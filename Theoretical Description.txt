Introduction
    The Internet is all about connecting machines together. One of the most exciting
    aspects of Python is that it incorporates an easy-to-use, cross-platform model for
    network communications that makes it possible to learn network programming
    without years of study. This opens up a whole new class of applications to
    programmers.

What is Socket ??
    Sockets are the endpoints of a bidirectional communications channel. Sockets may communicate within a process, between processes on  the same machine, or between processes on different continents.
    Sockets may be implemented over a number of different channel types: Unix domain sockets, TCP, UDP, and so on. The socket library provides specific classes for handling the common transports as well as a generic interface for handling the rest.

Socket's mostly used terms.
